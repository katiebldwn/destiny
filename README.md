* https://www.bungie.net/platform/destiny/help/ - Bungie's documentation of their public API
* https://github.com/SargoDarya/bungie-platform - Unofficial listing and information regarding the available Bungie.net endpoints.  Back when Bungie hadn't documented anything, this was my go-to resource.
* https://github.com/waltfy/destiny/ - A terrific node project for interacting with the Bungie.net API. Anyone developing along these lines should consider contributing to this codebase.
