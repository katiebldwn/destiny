Destiny Reputation Search
===================

Description
-------------
This project was the starting point for DestinyRep.com. At this point, both the server and front-end have been completely rewritten, but the core ideas are still the same. Connect to Bungie.net's API, gather character data starting with just a simple username search, & display it in a clear, simple fashion.
